Given an integer n denoting the Length of a line segment. You need to cut the line segment in such a way that the cut length of a line segment each time is either x , y or z. Here x, y, and z are integers.
After performing all the cut operations, your total number of cut segments must be maximum. Return the maximum number of cut segments possible.

Note: if no segment can be cut then return 0.

Examples:

Input: n = 4, x = 2, y = 1, z = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Total length is 4, and the cut
lengths are 2, 1 and 1.  We can make
maximum 4 segments each of length 1.
Input: n = 5, x = 5, y = 3, z = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Here total length is 5, and
the cut lengths are 5, 3 and 2. We can
make two segments of lengths 3 and 2.
Expected Time Complexity : O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints
1 <= n, x, y, z <= 104

        if (dp[n] != -1) return dp[n];

        int cutY = maximizeCutsHelper(n - y, x, y, z, dp) + 1;

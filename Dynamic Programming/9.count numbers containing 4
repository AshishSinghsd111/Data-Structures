You are given a number n, Return the count of total numbers from 1 to n containing 4 as a digit.

Examples:

Input: n = 9
Output: 1
Explanation: 4 is the only number between 1 to 9 which contains 4 as a digit.
Input: n = 44
Output: 9
Explanation: 4, 14, 24, 34, 40, 41, 42, 43 & 44, there are total 9 numbers containing 4 as a digit.
Expected Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105

  -->> java solution


class Solution {
    public static int countNumberswith4(int n) {
        int count=0;
       for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
           if(Integer.toString(i).contains("4")) count++;
       }
       return count;
    }
}

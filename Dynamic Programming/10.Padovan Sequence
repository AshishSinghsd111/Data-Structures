Given a number n, find the nth number in the Padovan Sequence.

A Padovan Sequence is a sequence which is represented by the following recurrence relation
P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3)
P(0) = P(1) = P(2) = 1

Note: Since the output may be too large, compute the answer modulo 10^9+7.

Examples :

Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: We already know, P1 + P0 = P3 and P1 = 1 and P0 = 1
Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: We already know, P4  = P2 + P1 and P2 = 1 and P1 = 1
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 106

        }
        else{
            arr[0] =1;
        arr[1]=1;
        arr[2]=1;
        
        for(int i=3; i<=n;i++){
            arr[i] = (arr[i-2]+arr[i-3])%m;
        }
        
        int ans = (int)arr[n];
        return ans;
        }
        
    }
    
}

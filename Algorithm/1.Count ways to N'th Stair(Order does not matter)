Examples :


Input: n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: Three ways to reach at 4th stair. They are {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 2}, {2, 2}.
Input: n = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: Three ways to reach at 5th stair. They are {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 2, 1} and {1, 2, 2}.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(n)

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 104

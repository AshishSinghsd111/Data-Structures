You are given a perimeter & the area. Your task is to return the maximum volume that can be made in the form of a cuboid from the given perimeter and surface area.
Note: Round off to 2 decimal places and for the given parameters, it is guaranteed that an answer always exists.

Examples

Input: perimeter = 22, area = 15
Output: 3.02
Explanation: The maximum attainable volume of the cuboid is 3.02
Input: perimeter = 20, area = 5
Output: 0.33
Explanation: The maximum attainable volume of the cuboid is 0.33
Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints :
1 ≤ perimeter ≤ 109
1 ≤ area ≤ 109

lass Solution {

    double maxVolume(double perimeter, double area) {
        
        double P = perimeter;
        double A = area;
        
        // Compute the intermediate terms to find dimensions
        double sqrtTerm = Math.sqrt(P * P - 24 * A);
        double dimension1 = (P - sqrtTerm) / 12.0;
        double dimension2 = (P / 4.0) - 2 * dimension1;
        
        // Calculate the volume
        double volume = Math.pow(dimension1, 2) * dimension2;
        
        // Round the result to two decimal places
        return Math.round(volume * 100.0) / 100.0;
    }
}
